***Dataset***

Review and select datasets from USGS GeoJSON Feed

Data updates every 5 minutes. Selected dataset that traces all earthquakes from past 7 days

Study JSON  

Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

By using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.

Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Implication: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

To Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
